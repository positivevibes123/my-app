**To Do List Website (WIP)**

This is a simple to-do list website with a login system. Users can add/remove tasks from a checklist, displayed on the screen. React.js is used for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and MySQL is used for the database. This project is currently a work in progress.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to build a web application that allows users to:

- Create a new account
- Log in
- Add/remove tasks to a to do list, which saves

**Technologies Used**

- React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Express, a web framework for Node.js
- Axios, a promise-based HTTP client for Node.js

**Project Setup**

- The frontend folder contains the React portion of the codebase. This portion is used to build a dynamic user interface using React components, and data is fetched from the backend server via HTTP requests.
- The backend folder contains the Express portion of the codebase. This portion is used to handle user requests, interact with the MySQL database, and keep track of user sessions.
- The MySQL database stores users and tasks, in their own respective tables.
